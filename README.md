This is a project made by Casey Chartier for the MSU full-stack development Bootcamp. It takes notes from the user and stores them locally in a JSON. The project features environment variables, express.js and express' router module, and is deployed to Heroku at https://taking-notes1337.herokuapp.com/. Future development would include dynamic updating of the page, implementation of the delete note functionality, and moving the database from a JSON file to some kind of SQL architecture.

This application is stored at https://github.com/MustyBraid/to-do-list which is not a very good name in hindisight. 

Feel free to use the code here in any way you see fit, this is intended primarily as a practice tool for educational purposes.
